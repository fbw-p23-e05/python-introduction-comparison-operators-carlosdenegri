#Task 1
# Your task is to write a program which asks the user three times about two integer numbers to compare.
# Hint: Use while loop to perform the same operation more than once!
# Use both comparison and logical operators, for example use logical comparison between two or more comparion operators:

# print("Task1"")
# i = 0
# while i < 3:
# 	num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# 	num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# 	if (num1 >= 999) and (num2 >= 999):
# 		size = 1
# 	else:
# 		size = 0
# 	if num1 != num2:
# 		print("Numbers are not equal")
# 	else:
# 		print("Numbers are equal")
# 	if num1 > num2:
# 		print("The first number is greater than the second number")
# 	else:
# 		print("The first number is lesser to the second number")
# 	if size == 1:
# 		print("Both numbers are large")
# 		print("Both numbers are set to True")
# 	else:
# 		print("Both numbers are small")
# 		print("Both numbers are set to False")
# 	i += 1

#Task 2

# print("Task2")
# print("List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December")
# month = str(input("Enter month: "))

# if (month == "January") or (month =="March") or (month == "May") or (month == "July") or (month == "August") or (month == "October") or (month == "December"):
# 	print(f"{month} has 31 days")
# elif month == "February":
# 	print(f"{month} has 28 or 29 days")
# else:
# 	print(f"{month} has 30 days")
